Using a list of available vials and their specific unit values, we want to calculate the most ideal dose as close to the ordered dose as possible. The allowable error margin from the ordered dose is +- 10%.

Units available:
 533 x4
 535 x3
 536 x1
 540 x6
 554 x1
 565 x2
 576 x2
1097 x4
1100 x4
1155 x2

Example 1:
Ordered dose (target): 3000
Minimum dose: 2700
Maximum dose: 3300

A few potential combinations:
1155, 1155, 576 (2886)
1097, 1097, 1097 (3291)
